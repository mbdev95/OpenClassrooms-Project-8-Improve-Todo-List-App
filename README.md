# Todo List Application Improvements and Documentation

## Introduction
This repository represents my final project with the online learning institution of OpenClassrooms. The goal of this project was to take pre-existing code from a todo list application and debug the code. In addition, I wrote tests to further optimize the todo list application. Futhermore, a formal audit report was written to discuss how the application can be optimized to scale better. Finally, I wrote technical documentation to summarize the programming of the application, with a focus on the use of Model-view-controller infrastructure. I am now comfortable with writing unit tests, audits and technical documentation.

## Adding More Unit Tests With Jasmine

![Unit-Test-Example-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77469447/128958280-2e073397-0b36-4bc1-9428-93d1a84dfa2f.PNG)

I added many more unit tests using Jasmine to make the testing robust in order to make the app more scaleable and to efficiently debug. The above image is a test I added determining if the active button will become highlighted when clicked on. A todo is created and passed down the model for storage in the database. When the active view is selected I expect view.render to have been called with the arguments "setFilter", and "active". The test passes since the arguments passed to view.render will trigger the active button to be highlighted in the active view.

![Unit-Test_Example-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77469447/128958290-65fb3333-46d1-4758-b775-29084d2868d6.PNG)

In the above image I test if a list item is successfully added to the database (i.e. model). I pass a todo list item's title into the addItem function.  The addItem function's execution triggers model.create() to execute, with the list item's title passed as an argument, in order to add the new todo list item to the database.  Thus, I expect model.create() to have been called with the todo list item's title and a callback function which will clear the newly added todo string from the input.

I understand the importance of using test driven-development before writing code so you can test for failures and only write code that passes, using testing as a guide to write your application through a refined process of trial and error, testing for ever greater complexities. I look forward to using testing driven-development as the tool to guide me when building future applications.

## Debugging Todo List Application

![debugging-example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77469447/128958071-143cc78f-4769-4b3d-9e05-83f1f0f66853.PNG)

I optimized a series of loops and corrected two major errors. The first error involved a simple syntax spelling error.  The second error was an id creation error where the ids were randomly generated leaving the possibility for multiple list items to have the same id. To avoid duplication of an id I made the new id equal to the length of the array holding all the todos, including any newly added todos, plus one, making the id for a new list item equal to all the list items plus one. The image above shows my correction to this error. 

The loops were optimized by eliminating unecessary loops and ensuring all the loops were executed for a number of iterations equal to an array length and not a variable holding an array length.
